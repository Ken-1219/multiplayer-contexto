## 🎮 About

Contexto is a word puzzle game where players try to guess a secret word by submitting guesses and receiving feedback based on semantic similarity. The game uses advanced machine learning models to understand the contextual relationships between words, providing a position ranking that indicates how close your guess is to the target word.

## ✨ Features

- **🌙 Dark Theme**: Beautiful, modern dark UI optimized for extended gameplay
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **⚡ Fast Performance**: Built with Next.js 15 and optimized for speed
- **🎨 Clean UI**: Minimal, distraction-free interface inspired by the original Contexto
- **💡 Hint System**: Get hints when you're stuck (limited per game)
- **📊 Game Statistics**: Track your progress and performance
- **🔄 Daily Games**: New puzzles based on daily game numbers
- **🎲 Unlimited Guesses**: No limit on attempts - keep trying until you find the word!
- **📋 Share Results**: Share your game results with friends

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Objective**: Find the secret word by making guesses
2. **Submit Guesses**: Type any word and press Enter
3. **Get Feedback**: Each guess receives a position number (1 = closest to the secret word)
4. **Use Context**: Words are ranked by semantic similarity using AI
5. **Keep Guessing**: No limit on attempts - use unlimited guesses
6. **Get Hints**: Use the hint feature if you're stuck (limited per game)
7. **Win**: Find the secret word (position #1) to complete the game!
